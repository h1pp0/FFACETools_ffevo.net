	- Fixed: Issues with chatlog cleaning when using Ashita
Version 1.3.1.13

Version 1.3.1.9
	- Add new enums to StatusEffect enum
	- Add Unknown, Everyones_Grudge, and Reaving_Wind value to SpellList enum
	- Add Unknown to AbilityList enum
	- Add Race enum
	- Add Unknown to MoonPhase, Weekday enums
	- Fix Player.CastPercentEx to use CastPercent * 100, it used to only return 2 possible values, 0 and 100.
	- Modify MenuTools.SelectedItemName to use ParseResources (it's more reliable), FFACE.GetSelectedItemName() if it fails, String.Empty if menu is not open.
	- Modify ParseResources... A LOT
	- ** ParseResources 
	- Add UseFFXIDatFiles, LanguagePreference, and Languages enum to ParseResources
	- **You will need to set these BEFORE calling 'new FFACE(pid)' if you need to either use resource xmls or a different language
	- Whether you choose FFXI Dats or Windower, you can choose a language BEFORE initing FFACE() by setting LanguagePreference to a valid Language enum
	- Add Get*Name for Item, Ability, Spell, Weather, Day, Race, Nation (technically Region), Short Job, Long Job, Area, Status, Moon
	- Add Get*Id for Item, Ability, Spell, Weather, Day, Race, Nation, Short Job, Long Job, Area, Status, Moon
	- Get*Name and Get*Id for Item, Ability, Spell, Area, Status always work, the rest require using FFXIDats to retrieve.
	- Add GetItemIds() for returning a list of valid IDs for a matching item name (Twashtar and most upgradeable weapons)
	- Race Names are of the form 'Race Gender', unless it's Race.Unknown.  Use this for parsing Gender/Race by splitting on the space.
	- ParseResources now works properly even without FFACE running (if you either set WindowerPath before calling it, or using FFXI Dats instead)
	- Big Thanks to eradicate on Windower IRC for the idea of the singleton class and giving me a small base to work with for testing.
	- If trying to use the d_Msg code from ParseResources, keep in mind it's only functional, not flawless.
	- Bump to 1.3.1.9, recompiled DLL
	
Version 1.3.1.8
	- Fix Exception throwing when using *Count property
	- Add UseArrowKeysForTurning property for setting whether to use ArrowKeys for turning.
	- *UseArrayKeysForTurning is only used if outside (HeadingTolerance / 2) but inside HeadingTolerance
	- *FaceHeading is still used if outside HeadingTolerance
	- Add CallingConvention.Cdecl to all imports. No more PInvokeStackImbalance warnings when running in the debugger.
	- SelectedItemName uses ParseResources, but if for some reason that doesn't work, resorts to the old way.
	- Bump to 1.3.1.8, recompiled DLL.

Version 1.3.1.7
	- Fix (possibly) cacheing issues with ParseResources.
	- Fix: Name of item is now stored in the cache with proper capitalization and won't harm the lookup either.
	- Benchmark: Tested ParseResources, 80s to load 974 items into the cache, 2.1s to use the exact same code again after cacheing.
	- Lower DistanceTolerance minimum to 0.25, testing indicates this is not too low of a number.
	- Add Synergy to CraftDetails and appropriate enum to Craft
	- Add Skill to CraftDetails (Craft enum)
	- Add a CraftRank enum
	- CraftDetails.Rank now returns a CraftRank enum.

	- Add GetAllCraftDetails which will return a List<> of CraftDetails
	- Add a MagicOrCombat enum for SkillDetails to be used with determining skill type.

	- Add a ToString() override for SkillDetails and a ToString(string) overload for 'special' formatting.
	- Move IsSet internal functions to FFACETools.cs to make them easier to access from anywhere within the assembly.
	- Add GetFirstIndexByItemID(int ID, InventoryType location) will return the first index occuppied by item matching ID.
	- Add GetItemCountByIndex(int index, InventoryType location) will return number of items at index in location.

	- Add GetItemCount(int iD, InventoryType location) will return total number of items matching ID in location.
	- Add GetItem(int index, InventoryType location) will return InventoryItem at index in location (first).
	- Change all Get* functions to use the InventoryType versions for returning information.
	- new TreasureItem class for accessing Treasure Pool information.
	- struct TREASUREITEM is now a private struct to allow for null return values from GetTreasureItem()
	- GetTreasureItem() can now return null if no item present.
	- Add OpenTradeMenu(int) for use with NPCS ONLY. This does NOT work with PCs and will return Failed if attempted.
	- Made OpenTradeMenu(int) start it's own thread for this purpose (it stops after 30 seconds no matter what).
	- Add public bool SetTradeGil(uint Gil); for putting JUST gil into the Trade Menu
	- Last step in phasing out GetLineExtra and GetLineRaw completed.
	- Fix GetPlayerInformation.Buffs() being off by one 'short' in size (2 bytes)
	- Fix LimitPoints and MeritPoints being off by one 'short' in size (2 bytes)

	- Add Pianissimo to the AbilityList enum
			
Version 1.3.1.6
	- Change all .Equals() functions where type may be different to use the == or != check instead where appropriate.
	- UInt32.Equals(Int32) always retuns false, so checking ushort IDs vs int IDs always returned false.
	
Version 1.3.1.5
	- Add SatchelCount, SafeCount, TemporaryCount, LockerCount, SackCount, StorageCount (analog of InventoryCount)
	- Fix InventoryItem stuff to allow indexes from 0 to 80.  The rest require indexes from 1 to 80.
	- Internal: Reorganize NavigatorTools
	- Cap HeadingTolerance to a range of 5 to 175
	- Cap DistanceTolerance to a range of 0.75 to 49
	- Add HeadingType enum for the purpose of consolidating a lot of common functions.

	- Rename the GotoXZ/GotoXYZ overloads to just Goto (they were all using the same code)
	- Fix Goto to avoid running if we're within DistanceTolerance to Target values.
	- Along with above, Goto will NOT set FirstPersonView unless we are outside of DistanceTolerance
	- Goto also will return immediately if the X, Y, Z coords are all 0 (Why are you chasing yourself WHILE ZONING?!)
	- Consolidate all Face* overloads into FaceHeading overloads.
	- Add FaceHeading(ID) variety
	- Add DistanceTo(ID) variety

	- Add SetViewMode, used in Goto automatically.  SAVE PLAYER'S VIEWMODE BEFORE CALLING GOTO* METHODS IF YOU WISH TO RESTORE IT AFTER RUNNING IT.
	- DO NOT REPLACE OLD DLLs WITH THIS ONE. This version WILL break backward compatibility. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!
	- Also, fuck backward compatibility. :-)
	- Updated wiki...
